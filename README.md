# PROJECT-Rock-Paper-Scissors
I got a project to develop, The Rock, Paper, Scissors Game and it's a simple and fun GUI-based project developed in C language. It allows the user to play the classic hand game against the computer. The computer makes a random choice between Rock, Paper, or Scissors, and decides the winner according to their selection.
